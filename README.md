# AI Model for Space Education

This project is an AI-driven application designed to enhance space education by leveraging machine learning models for analysis and prediction. The backend is built using Python with Flask, and the frontend is implemented with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- ✅ AI model for space-related predictions
- ✅ Video and image carousel for interactive learning
- ✅ Flask backend for API integration
- ✅ Local deployment for testing and development

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- 🐍 Python 3.10 or 3.11 (Recommended)
- 🔥 Flask
- 🔗 Git
- 🌐 A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maknoonisar/AI-model-for-space-education.git
cd AI-model-for-space-education/backend
Create a Virtual Environment:
bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
Install Dependencies:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Project Locally
Start the Backend
bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
This will start the Flask server, which runs on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ by default.

Open the Frontend
Navigate to the frontend folder and open index.html in a browser.

Ensure the video and image assets are correctly referenced in /assets/.

Deployment
For deployment, consider using Flask with Gunicorn on a cloud platform or Docker for containerization. If deploying on Streamlit Community Cloud, ensure the app is structured accordingly.

Troubleshooting
Flask does not run? Verify dependencies using:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip freeze
Assets do not load? Ensure the paths are correctly configured.

CORS issues? Install Flask-CORS:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install flask-cors
Then, add this to app.py:

python
Copy
Edit
from flask_cors import CORS
CORS(app)
